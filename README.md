### Hi ðŸ‘‹

As an enthusiastic software engineer, I live and breathe software development. My journey in the tech world is driven by a passion for clean code, problem-solving, and relentless learning.

I have a solid foundation in Ruby and eagerly dive into personal projects using Elixir.

I value collaborative environments that promote teamwork and maintain a healthy work-life balance.

â˜• Let's connect? I love exchanging ideas about technology and innovation!
