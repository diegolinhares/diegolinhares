### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate software engineer deeply dedicated to the art of software development. My journey in the tech world is fueled by a love for clean code, problem-solving, and continuous learning.

I have a solid background in working with Ruby, and I also enjoy diving into personal projects with Elixir.

I appreciate collaborative environments that encourage teamwork and a balanced work-life dynamic.
